ToolWindowManager
=================

Qt based tool window manager.

This project implements docking tool behavior that is similar to behavior of tool windows in Visual Studio or Eclipse. User can arrange tool windows in tabs, dock it to any border, split with vertical and horizontal splitters, tabify them together and detach to floating windows. 

The magic is implemented in the ToolWindowManager class. Other files are provided just for an example of using it.
